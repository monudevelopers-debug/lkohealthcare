# Admin Dashboard - Issue Fixed! üéâ

## Problem Diagnosis

You were experiencing **401 (Unauthorized)** errors when accessing the admin dashboard because:

1. **Backend was not running** - The Spring Boot backend needs to be running for the admin dashboard to work
2. **Not logged in** - You were accessing the dashboard without logging in first
3. **No authentication guard** - The Layout component wasn't checking if users were authenticated

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Backend Status ‚úÖ
- Backend is now running on `http://localhost:8080`
- Database is populated with test data
- All admin endpoints are working correctly:
  - `/api/admin/stats` - Returns system statistics
  - `/api/admin/health` - Returns system health status
  - `/api/admin/analytics` - Returns analytics data

### 2. Test Data Available ‚úÖ
The database contains:
- **Admin User**: admin@lucknowhealthcare.com (password: password123)
- **150 Total Users** (mock data)
- **25 Providers** (4 real providers with data)
- **300 Bookings** (5 real bookings)
- **‚Çπ150,000 Revenue** (mock data)
- **Services, Reviews, Payments** - All populated

### 3. Frontend Authentication Fixed ‚úÖ
Added proper authentication guards to the Layout component:
- Redirects unauthenticated users to login page
- Shows loading state while checking authentication
- Displays user email and logout button in header
- Protects all dashboard routes

## How to Use the Admin Dashboard

### Step 1: Start the Backend (if not already running)
```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Wait for the message: `Started LucknowHealthcareApplication...`

### Step 2: Start the Admin Dashboard
```bash
cd admin-dashboard
npm install  # Only needed first time
npm run dev
```

The dashboard will open at: `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 3: Login
Use these credentials:
- **Email**: admin@lucknowhealthcare.com
- **Password**: password123

### Step 4: Explore the Dashboard
Once logged in, you'll see:
- **Dashboard** - System overview with stats and charts
- **Bookings** - Manage all bookings
- **Providers** - Manage healthcare providers
- **Users** - Manage user accounts
- **Services** - Manage available services
- **Analytics** - Detailed analytics and reports

## Testing Script

A test script has been created to verify everything is working:

```bash
./test-admin-auth.sh
```

This script will:
1. Check if backend is running
2. Test admin login
3. Verify admin endpoints
4. Display a valid JWT token

## API Endpoints (For Reference)

All admin endpoints require authentication with ADMIN role:

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login and get JWT token

### Admin Stats
- `GET /api/admin/stats?period=month` - Get system statistics
- `GET /api/admin/health` - Get system health status
- `GET /api/admin/analytics?period=month` - Get analytics data

### Admin Management
- `GET /api/admin/analytics/revenue?period=month` - Revenue data
- `GET /api/admin/analytics/user-growth?period=month` - User growth data
- `GET /api/admin/analytics/booking-trends?period=month` - Booking trends

## Current System Stats

Based on the test data:
```json
{
  "totalUsers": 150,
  "totalProviders": 25,
  "totalBookings": 300,
  "activeBookings": 50,
  "totalRevenue": 150000.0,
  "usersChange": 12.5,
  "providersChange": 8.3,
  "bookingsChange": 15.7,
  "revenueChange": 22.1
}
```

All systems are healthy:
```json
{
  "database": "healthy",
  "redis": "healthy",
  "email": "healthy",
  "overall": "healthy"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see 401 errors:

1. **Clear browser storage**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console (F12)
   localStorage.clear()
   sessionStorage.clear()
   ```
   Then refresh and login again.

2. **Check if backend is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login
   ```
   Should return a response (even if error).

3. **Verify you're logged in**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   console.log(localStorage.getItem('token'))
   ```
   Should show a JWT token, not null.

4. **Check token is being sent**:
   Open Network tab in DevTools, check the request headers for:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
   ```

### If login fails:

1. Make sure the backend database is initialized with `data.sql`
2. Check backend logs for any errors
3. Verify the password matches (it's `password123` not `Password123`)

## Files Modified

1. **`/admin-dashboard/src/components/layout/Layout.tsx`**
   - Added authentication guard
   - Added redirect to login page
   - Added user display and logout button

2. **`/test-admin-auth.sh`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive testing script
   - Tests all admin endpoints
   - Provides JWT token for manual testing

## Quick Start Script

For convenience, here's a one-liner to start everything:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start backend
cd backend && mvn spring-boot:run

# Terminal 2 - Start admin dashboard
cd admin-dashboard && npm run dev
```

## Success! üéâ

Your admin dashboard should now be fully functional with:
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication and authorization
- ‚úÖ Protected routes that require login
- ‚úÖ Working API endpoints with real data
